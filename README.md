**Localhost.ai - Kaonashi version**
## Introduction

**Prerequisites**:
- Install ElasticSearch 7.14 (just unzip and go to bin folder an double-click on elastic.bat))
- Dotnet core 8.0 
- Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code

**Introduction**:
After years of working on AI projects, both professionally and personally,I’ve initiated the **Localhost.AI version Kaonashi** project.  
A solution based on the [Democrite agent distribution framework](https://github.com/jeromefortias/Democrite), where I’m trying to combine:
- AI Assistant  
- AI applied to document management  
- Intelligence algorithms  

I’m not a real developer, but rather an **AI Architect**—so it’s not exactly easy.  
I named this project **Kaonashi**, after the faceless character from a movie I love, *Spirited Away*.  

This project will also give me the opportunity to explain different approaches on my YouTube channel:

## Objectives
The main goal of *Kaonashi* is to provide **non-developers**, for free, with a complete environment to create their own **AI companion**, where:
- We work not only on **knowledge**, but also on **psychology**  
- We experiment and have fun making our AI **dream**

## Features
- 🧠 **Knowledge + Psychology**: mix structured information with emotional layers  
- 👁️ **Vision & IoT Sensors**: connect AI to the physical world  
- 💻 **Localhost First**: not meant to be a massive chatbot server, but a **local solution** anyone can run  
- 🎮 **Hobby-Oriented**: a sandbox to create your own artificial intelligent entity, just for fun
